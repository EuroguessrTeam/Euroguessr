## Overview

**Are you a real fan of Eurovision ? Euroguessr will tell you that !  
With only 1 second of audio, your goal is to find the corresponding Eurovision song.  
If 1 second is too short for you don't worry, everytime you miss, you got extra seconds of listening !**

**This site was created with the main aim of entertaining Eurovision fans, and enabling the community to test their knowledge of the contest, as well as discovering new sounds they didn't know about.**
